## about me

Hi, I'm Misa Haneda.

I'm interested in exploring the range of possibilities of how human can be.

So recently I like to learn about human history (I’m a big fan of COTEN radio that podcast on Spotify) and read science fiction novel (I like “The left hand of darkness” written by Ursula K Le Guin) to know how human are in different environments than we do now.

Someday I would like to learn about the ecology of other creatures like apes.

I have also recently begun to create my own artwork (I like using TouchDesigner).

The concept of this work is to attempt to simulate a life span.
