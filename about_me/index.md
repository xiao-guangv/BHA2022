Hi, I'm Misa Haneda.

I'm interested in exploring the range of possibilities of human society and ways of life.

So recently I like to learn about human history(I’m a big fan of COREN radio that podcast on Spotify) and read science fiction novel(I like “The left hand of darkness” written by Ursula K Le Guin).

I would like to learn someday the way of life of other creatures such as apes.

I have also recently begun to create my own artwork (I like using TouchDesigner).

The concept of this work is to attempt to simulate a life span.
You can watch the video if you like.
(If you have any comments or English corrections, I will be glad to hear them!)
