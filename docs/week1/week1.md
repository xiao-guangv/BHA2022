3:Answer the following questions:
- What is Life? How would you define it, can you actually define it?<br>
→I think the conditions for being life can be listed, but not clearly defined.<br>

- What is BioHacking? What does it mean for you?<br>
→Bio Hacking means “do it yourself and think for yourself” for me.<br>
Through Bio Hacking, I want to change the way I see the world, especially to feel the wonder of life activity.<br>
I also want to deepen my own thinking about "what is life?".

- Why are you interested in Bio?<br>
→Because I learned that genetic modification is something that has been going on in nature ever since bacteria and other life forms were born (from "What is sex?" written by Lynn Margulis).<br>

I want to know what genetic modification is all about by seeing it with my own eyes and hands.<br>
I am also intersteed in  what happens to genes when a fertilized egg is formed in humans.
