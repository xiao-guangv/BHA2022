###  pattern6: Colored slime mold<br>

The slime mold itself was colored red and blue.<br>
When they mingle, will they separate as separate individuals, still blue and red respectively? Or will they merge into the same individual?<br>
**Prediction: They will coalesce and become purple.**

Not sure how it will turn out yet. And despite the Bactu Agar it appears to be slow growing.<br>
