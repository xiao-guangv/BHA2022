## week2: Deconstructing the Lab (2022/3/7~3/13)

### (a) I made a [FOLDSCOPE](https://www.foldscope.com/)<br>
[Manu Prakash](https://www.ted.com/talks/manu_prakash_a_50_cent_microscope_that_folds_like_origami?language=ja) developped this microscope made of paper.

notes: When observing, z-axis adjustment is important. This time, it was observed beautifully in its thinnest state.<br>

### (a') About the microscope in the first place<br>
[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek) made the first microscope.<br>
How was he able to create the microscopic lenses?
Many thought it was polished.
In reality, he produced beautiful lenses by heating and melting glass, then dropping it into water and letting it cool.<br>

There are two types of microscopes.
  1. Type viewd from top<br>
    Mainly used to observe fixed and immobile objects. Use slides.

  2. Type viewed from below<br>
    Mainly used to observe cells, bacteria, and moving objects in petri dishes.<br>
   (When viewed from above, it is difficult to see the evaporated water droplets. So look from the bottom)<br>

### (b) I made a pocketPCR
Polymerase Chain Reaction: A means of copying large quantities of DNA.
- Purpose of PCR<br>
 By copying in large quantities, the DNA can be analyzed by electrophoresis. We can investigate what kind of DNA is present.
- How PCR works<br>
  Repeat cooling (50 degrees) and heating (95 degrees).
  Taq polymerase, primers, a large amount of discrete ATCG, and DNA are placed in the liquid.
  At 95 degrees, the DNA chain is separated.
  At 50 degrees, the DNA and primer attach, then the polymerase attaches ATCG and copies the other end.
  This is repeated many many times.

- electrophoresis<br>
  DNA is negative.
  When electricity is passed through it, it tries to go to the positive side.
  DNA is injected into agar.
  Smaller lengths (fewer bases) move quickly. Move a lot.
