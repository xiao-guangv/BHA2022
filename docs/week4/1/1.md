###  1. Make cultivation media for bacteria and plants<br>
**■day1 - 22/3/2022 Tue : How to make and prepare medium<br>**

**Recipes**
* 500ml purified water
* 12g sugar
* 6g Agar
* a little bit of Vitamin<br>
※This is the basic recipe. It depends on the bacteria you want to grow.<br>
What bacteria like, humans like too. Vitamins, sugar, chicken soup, etc.

**1. Measure water and set on the magnetic stirrer<br>**
To prevent spills, the amount of liquid should be about half of the bottle.<br>

**2. Measure sugar and add it into water<br>**
To prevent contamination, if you take out more than your portion, do not put it back in the original bag.<br>

**3. Measure agar and add it into water<br>**
Add the agar slowly, as it will clump up when added all at once.

**6. Set the bottle in the autoclave and start pressurization<br>**
Make sure the bottom of the autoclave is properly filled with water.<br>
You can't steam without water.<br>
Kick and if it makes a wave, it's OK!<br>
※If there is no water in the bottle, add purified water.<br>
