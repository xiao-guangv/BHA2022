###  1. Make cultivation media for bacteria and plants<br>
**■day1 - 22/3/2022 Tue : How to make and prepare medium<br>**

**Recipes**
* 500ml purified water
* 12g sugar
* 6g Agar
* a little bit of Vitamin<br>
※This is the basic recipe. It depends on the bacteria you want to grow.<br>
What bacteria like, humans like too. Vitamins, sugar, chicken soup, etc.

**1. Measure water and set on the magnetic stirrer<br>**
To prevent spills, the amount of liquid should be about half of the bottle.<br>

**2. Measure sugar and add it into water<br>**
To prevent contamination, if you take out more than your portion, do not put it back in the original bag.<br>

**3. Measure agar and add it into water<br>**
Add the agar slowly, as it will clump up when added all at once.

**6. Set the bottle in the autoclave and start pressurization<br>**
Make sure the bottom of the autoclave is properly filled with water.<br>
You can't steam without water.<br>
Kick and if it makes a wave, it's OK!<br>
※If there is no water in the bottle, add purified water.<br>

**7. Autoclaved!!**<br>
When pressure returns to zero, you can open it.<br>

*Purpose of autoclave*
(a)To sterilize. To create an environment for only one target organism to be cultured.<br>
(b)To completely dissolve agar.

**8. Pour the liquid into a petri dish<br>**
Petri dish bags are opened in a clean bench.<br>
Items to be placed in the clean bench must be sprayed with alcohol before being placed in it.<br>

When the liquid reaches human skin, begin pouring.<br>
Liquid can be added until the floor of the petri dish is filled.<br>
Do not turn the lid of the petri dish upside down.<br>

Wait until it hardens. <br>
