## week3: DMaking the Lab (2022/3/14~3/20)

###  1. Install and Test at least 2 different 3D Applications<br>
I downloaded free non-commercial version of Fusion and Blender.
I was able to open the .stl file in both software programs.

â€»It took almost 15min to download and setup Fusion.

There are too many features.
I am not sure which mark is what function.
