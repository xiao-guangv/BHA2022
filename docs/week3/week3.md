## week3: Making the Lab (2022/3/14~3/20)

###  1. Install and Test at least 2 different 3D Applications<br>
I downloaded free non-commercial version of Fusion and Blender.
I was able to open the .stl file in both software programs.

â€»It took almost 15min to download and setup Fusion.<br>

In blender, STL software opened when I selected "import" instead of "open".<br>

There are too many features.
I am not sure which mark is what function.

When I tried to manipulate something in blender, I got this error.<br>

By the way: for TouchDesigner, .stl files were not supported.<br>
I changed .stl to .fbx and was able to import.<br>

I made a cleanbench with Shiho and Ai.<br>

#### (1) Sketch a design image

#### (2) Production started
We tried to make holes to put your hands in, window to look in and holes and ducts for airflow (holes have filters).
