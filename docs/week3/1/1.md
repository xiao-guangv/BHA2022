###  1. Install and Test at least 2 different 3D Applications<br>
I downloaded free non-commercial version of Fusion and Blender.
I was able to open the .stl file in both software programs.

â€»It took almost 15min to download and setup Fusion.<br>

In blender, STL software opened when I selected "import" instead of "open".<br>

There are too many features.
I am not sure which mark is what function.

When I tried to manipulate something in blender, I got this error.<br>

By the way: for TouchDesigner, .stl files were not supported.<br>
I changed .stl to .fbx and was able to import.<br>
