  ↑There was cellulose also in the bottle filled only with kelp tea! (NO.11)


- **Finally we tasted them!!**<br>
  NO.1, 2, 9 taste really good!!<br>
  It seems that NO.9 is combined with the droth.<br>

  On the other hand, bottles that had not fermented at all tasted quite bad.So, I added new SCOBY to them.<br>
