- **Feature**<br>
In the store, some of the pickles are fermented and made. In particular, Aomori's ["Godo"](https://hirakuogura.com/?p=12001) is rarely sold outside of Aomori Prefecture, and Hakko department receives the bacteria from Aomori to make it. The company is currently developing the product for sale.<br>
